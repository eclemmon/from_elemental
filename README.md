## ON BOOT

### Instrument and Network Selection

There are several options to select from when the program runs.

###### SELECT YOUR INSTRUMENT OPTIONS

Selecting cello or violin will define the scores that the respective player
receives.

If the players are co-located and on the same local network, they
can select the local network option to automatically distribute
the scores available to each player.

If the players are not co-located or not on the same local network,
they can set the score distribution manually.

###### AMOUNT OF PRE-ROLL

Enter a number that displays how many seconds in time before the work
starts. This is helpful in both performance and rehearsal settings.

###### SECTIONS

The section selection buttons are for rehearsal purposes. To start
at the beginning of the piece, simply select Section 1. 

### Set Scores Manually

![Alt text](readme_images/manual_score_selection.png)

As described in the GUI, the violinist (or alternatively, the cellist)
hits the randomize button, and then tells the other player which cells are 
'not selected'. The other player then selects those options and 'not
selected' for the options the violinist has as 'selected'.

### Set Scores Automatically

![Alt text](readme_images/automatic_score_selection.png)

One player selects server, the other selects client. When the server
option is selected it will autofill the server's local IP address,
at which point the player who has selected client can copy the
number. NB: if client is selected, you need to ask the player
who has selected Server for the number in their text fieldâ€”clicking
'Server' will give you your own (the client's) IP-Address and 
not the servers.

The server must submit first, otherwise the client will not be able
to connect.

### Main Score GUI

######First Section

![Alt text](readme_images/main_score_gui.png)

In the main score GUI, during the first section, players are tacet.
The quit button will always close out the entire program. During the
first section, the 'NEXT CELL' button is disabled. 

![Alt text](readme_images/main_score_gui_2.png)

Once the main score GUI progresses past the 1st section, players
can begin to play and can click on the NEXT CELL button to receive
assigned cells at random.
