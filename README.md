# ABOUT THE PROJECT

Code by <a href=https://ericlemmon.net/>Eric Lemmon</a>, scores and music by <a href=https://www.annesophieandersen.com/>
Anne Sophie Andersen</a> and Eric Lemmon

This repository holds the scores, instructions, and code for the collaboration between Anne Sophie Andersen 
and Eric Lemmon for their work titled:

### **From Elemental Singularities to Unified Complexities:**

###### a microcosmic journey

This work was premiered on the <a href=https://www.newmusicforstrings.org/concerts-2021/>
2021 New Music for String festival</a> held in Aarhus and Copenhagen Denmark.

## PERFORMER INSTRUCTIONS

[Download performer instructions here.](performer_instructions.pdf)

## INSTRUCTIONS FOR RUNNING THE SOFTWARE

NB: These instructions are for OSX only. The software does run well for windows, however. Some familiarity with 
PowerShell or another CLI is necessary.

### INSTALLATION

If you haven't installed Python, 
<a href=https://www.python.org/downloads/>install it by downloading it here.</a>
The software has been tested in Python 3.8 and up.

> You can also install python through brew:

`brew install python@3.10`

> Navigate to the directory that you want the folder to be downloaded to in the
CLI of your choice (e.g. terminal on mac):

`cd Users/your_user_name_here/Desktop`

>If you don't have git installed and your OS is OSX, you can open terminal and install it with other cli tools in x-code select:

`xcode-select --install`

> Download the software by copying this into the CLI. 

`git clone https://github.com/eclemmon/from_elemental`

>If you do not want to install CLI tools, you can also download the codebase as a .zip file:

![Alternative code download](/blob/download_code.png)

>Install Pillow, a necessary python package:

`python3 -m pip install Pillow`

You are now ready to run From Elemental!

### Running the Software

Now that you installed all the necessary dependencies for From Elemental, you can run it like so:

>Navigate into the directory:

`cd /path/to/from_elemental-main`

You can achieve this easily by typing in `cd` + dragging the file directory into terminal.

Run the program:

`python3 main.py`

## ON BOOT

### Instrument and Network Selection

There are several options to select from when the program runs.

![Alt text](blob/instrument_network_settings.png)

###### SELECT YOUR INSTRUMENT OPTIONS

Selecting a particular instrument will define the scores that the respective player
receives.

If the players are co-located and on the same local network, they
can select the local network option to automatically distribute
the scores available to each player.

If the players are not co-located or not on the same local network,
they can set the score distribution manually.

###### TRIGGER NEXT IMAGE OPTIONS

The GUI offers three means by which a performer can select next the next image.
If the performer is using a page turning foot pedal (<a href=https://www.pageflip.com/>like so</a>),
the performer can map the foot pedal to the left mouse button on their computer
and tapping the pedal with the mouse cursor over the window will get the next
image when the 'foot pedal' option is selected. The 'space bar' option is a 
convenience option for performance if the performer has no foot pedal available 
to them. In this case, the space bar will be an available trigger button that 
gets the next graphic or notated cell since the spacebar is a large key and 
towards the front of a laptop's keyboard. The 'next button' option, will only
get images when the large 'next' button in the window is clicked. In all cases
the next button will still work.

NB: because the base OS keycodes differ between mac and windows, sometimes the 
spacebar will not function on windows machines. 

###### AMOUNT OF PRE-ROLL

Enter a number that displays how many seconds in time before the work
starts. This is helpful in both performance and rehearsal settings.

###### SECTIONS

The section selection buttons are for rehearsal purposes. To start
at the beginning of the piece, simply select Section 1. 

### Set Scores Manually

![Alt text](blob/manual_score_selection.png)

The electronics player uses the score primarily to track
the section that all the players are in (think of it as a 
timer on steroids if you are playing this part). So this 
performer can hit randomize and wait for the other players.

As described in the GUI, the lead player
hits the randomize button, and then tells the other player(s) which cells are 
'not selected'. The other player(s) then set 'not
selected' for the options the lead player has as 'selected'. If there
are more than two players (beyond the electronics part), the
next player then hits randomize and the process continues until
all the players have finished selecting cells.

### Set Scores Automatically

![Alt text](blob/automatic_score_selection.png)

One player selects server, the other selects client. When the server
option is selected it will autofill the server's local IP address,
at which point the player who has selected client can copy the
number. NB: if client is selected, you need to ask the player
who has selected Server for the number in their text fieldâ€”clicking
'Server' will give you your own (the client's) IP-Address and 
not the servers.

The server must submit first, otherwise the client will not be able
to connect.

### Main Score GUI

###### First Section

![Alt text](blob/main_score_gui.png)

In the main score GUI, during the first section, players are tacet.
The quit button will always close out the entire program. During the
first section, the 'NEXT CELL' button is disabled. 

![Alt text](blob/main_score_gui_2.png)

Once the main score GUI progresses past the 3rd section, players
can begin call for assigned cells based on the instructions provided
at the top of this README.
